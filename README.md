# Pi-Compute-PGS
Portable gaming system based on the Raspberry Pi Compute module

I took this project as far as I possibly could but ran out of steam. I figured I would open source it so other people can take it up if they like. The major revisions I was facing are as follows:

1. The buttons need to be moved further away from the screen.
I designed the board independent of designing the enclosure which was a huge mistake. There is not enough clearance around the screen to accomodate a correctly sized button.
2. I ordered the wrong battery IC and ended up frying a prototype board trying to simultaneosy play and charge the PGS.
3. Stereo out
4. HDMI out
5. On-board WiFi

This board was designed in a 4.x version of KiCad and has not been updated to 5.0+ so I'm not sure how it will behave.
